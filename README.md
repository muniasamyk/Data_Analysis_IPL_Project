## Prediction File

https://github.com/muniasamyk/Data_Analysis_IPL_Project/blob/main/IPL_Data_Prediction.ipynb

## Getting Started

1. **Prepare Data Files**  
   - Place your `ipl_matches.csv` and `ipl_players.csv` files in the root directory.
   - Ensure `ipl_matches.csv` has columns like `id`, `season`, `team1`, `team2`, `winning_team`, etc.
   - Ensure `ipl_players.csv` has columns like `id` (match id), `batter`, `bowler`, `batsman_run`, `iswicket_delivery`, `player_out`, etc.

## Example Outputs

- Likely Orange Cap (most runs, latest season): _Player Name_ (_Runs_)
- Likely Purple Cap (most wickets, latest season): _Player Name_ (_Wickets_)
- Predicted winner for MI vs CSK: _Team Name_
- Likely IPL Cup Winner: _Team Name_ (Total Projected Wins: _N_)

## Customization

- Add more features to the ML model by engineering new columns (e.g., player form, head-to-head stats).
- Integrate with web dashboards using Streamlit or Flask.
- Update `upcoming_match_details` in the script to predict new matches.
