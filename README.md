# IPL Analysis & Prediction Dashboard (Power BI + Machine Learning)

This project brings together Power BI and Machine Learning to analyze and predict key insights from the Indian Premier League (IPL).
The dashboard offers a complete view of team and player performances, match outcomes, and season highlights â€” all in one interactive place.

### Overview

The IPL Analysis Dashboard is designed to help cricket fans, analysts, and data enthusiasts explore IPL data visually and intelligently.
It combines historical IPL data, visualization in Power BI, and prediction using Python and scikit-learn.

### Dashboard Highlights

Title Winner â€“ Displays the champion team of the selected season.

Orange Cap â€“ Highlights the top run-scorer.

Purple Cap â€“ Shows the leading wicket-taker.

Tournament Stats â€“ Total 4s and 6s hit throughout the season.

Batting Insights â€“ View total runs, boundaries, and strike rates for any batsman.

Bowling Insights â€“ Check wickets, economy, average, and strike rate for bowlers.

## Match Analysis

Wins by Toss Decision

Wins by Result Type (runs, wickets, super over)

Team-wise total wins

ðŸ”¹ Team Insights

Who won the IPL in the selected season?

How many matches did each team win?

Which venue had the most exciting finishes?

ðŸ”¹ Player Insights

Who earned the Orange Cap and Purple Cap?

Whatâ€™s a playerâ€™s total runs, fours, sixes, and strike rate?

Which bowlers maintained the best economy and wicket averages?

ðŸ”¹ Match Trends

How did toss decisions affect match outcomes?

How many 4s and 6s were scored overall?

How do teams usually win â€” by runs, wickets, or super overs?

## Data Model

All tables are connected through well-defined relationships for efficient querying and insights.


### Dashboard Preview

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Power BI â€“ Interactive data visualization

Excel / SQL â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing

Python (scikit-learn) â€“ Machine learning for prediction

### How to Use

Download the .pbix file.

Open it in Power BI Desktop.

Explore different pages and filters â€” choose a season, team, player, or venue.

Gain instant insights through interactive visuals.

## Predictive Analytics (Machine Learning)

This project also includes an IPL Prediction Model that forecasts Orange Cap, Purple Cap, and match winners using historical data.

## Prediction Capabilities

Predicts top run-scorer (Orange Cap) and top wicket-taker (Purple Cap).

Estimates match winners for specific fixtures.

Uses Random Forest and other models from scikit-learn.

Can be easily integrated into Streamlit or Flask web apps.

#### Example Outputs
